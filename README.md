As part of our final research project for Microsoft Research Data Science School, we replicated an [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/irv.12816). The article written during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic studied different socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 positive cases in New York City (NYC) by Zip codes. It examined the extent to which the variability in Zip code-level case positivity can be explained by socioeconomic factors and daily change in mobility.

In our replication, we verify and critique their results and claims. Click at [Research Replication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msr-ds3/covid-nyc-2022-group-5/main/Research-Replication.html) to read our work.
